# GuessingGame

Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number (generated randomly between 0 and 1000000). 
After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. 
At the end the number of tries needed to guess the value should be printed on the screen. 
You should count as only one try if the user is guessing the same value multiple times consecutively.
